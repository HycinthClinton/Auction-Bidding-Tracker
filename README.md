# Auction-Bidding-Tracker
This is a simple command-line Python program that simulates an auction bidding process. This program allows multiple participants to place their bids and keeps track of the highest bid in real time. Participants can input their name and bid amount, and the program validates the input to ensure only valid bids are accepted. Once there are no more bidders, the program announces the highest bidder and the winning bid.
