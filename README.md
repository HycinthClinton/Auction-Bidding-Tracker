# Auction-Bidding-Tracker
This is a simple command-line Python program that simulates an auction bidding process. This program allows multiple participants to place their bids and keeps track of the highest bid in real time. Participants can input their name and bid amount, and the program validates the input to ensure only valid bids are accepted. Once there are no more bidders, the program announces the highest bidder and the winning bid.

#Features:
1. Real-Time Bid Tracking: Continuously tracks bids and updates the highest bidder and their respective bid amount.
2. Input Validation: Ensures that only valid numeric bid amounts are accepted to prevent errors during execution.
3. Interactive Interface: Engages users with input prompts, making the process easy to understand and interactive.
4. End Condition: Stops accepting bids when users declare that no more participants are bidding.
